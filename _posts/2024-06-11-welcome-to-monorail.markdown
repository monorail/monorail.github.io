Welcome to the monorail blog!

This is where I will infrequently update my learning and side projects. 
I am currently an intern at a data center, and in community college for cybersecurity and coding.
Current projects include spinning up an old server and a project to log bird calls in my backyard.  
Check back more updates soon
